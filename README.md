Undertale Engine is a GameMaker project template with pre-made code and resources all ready for making Undertale fangames.
It includes the battle system, the overworld system, the multi-language system alongside other various useful features.
It is originally based on old GameMaker Studio 2 versions (prior than 2.3).
We are currently upgrading the project to comply with the latest GameMaker feature changes.
